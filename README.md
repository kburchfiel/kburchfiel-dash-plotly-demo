# kburchfiel-dash-plotly-demo
This project shows how Plotly, Dash, and a PostgreSQL database can be utilized to create an online data visualization app. I chose Google Cloud Run as a host since Heroku's free tier will end in November 2022.

The project is still a work in progress, but you can visit https://kjb3-plotly-aviation-demo-repository-visfgcmd7a-uc.a.run.app/ to see the current state of the dashboard. It may take a little while to load at first.
